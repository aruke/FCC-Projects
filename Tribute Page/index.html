            <p>George Washington Carver was an American botanist and inventor. The exact day and year of his birth are
                unknown; he was born into slavery in Missouri, either in 1861, or January
                1864.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Carver's reputation is largely based on his promotion of alternative crops to cotton, such as peanuts and
                sweet potatoes. He wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops both as a source of their own food and
                as a
                source of other products to improve their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical
                bulletins
                for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts. He spent years developing and promoting numerous
                products made from peanuts; none were commercially successful. He was also a leader in promoting
                environmentalism. He received numerous honors for his work, including the Spingarn Medal of the
                NAACP.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>In an era of very high racial polarization, his fame reached beyond the black community. He was widely
                recognized and praised in the white community for his many achievements and talents. In 1941, Time
                magazine
                dubbed Carver a "Black Leonardo"</p>
